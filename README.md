Bracketology 2024

I created a model to predict what the March Madness Bracket would look like in 2024. I took data from past tournaments, such as NET, Kenpom, BPI, KPI, SOR, Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 Wins, Losses, and Percentages to train my model and then used team tourney sheets with this year's data to predict the 2024 Tournament
